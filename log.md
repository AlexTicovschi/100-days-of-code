### Day 2: January 2, 2017
##### [HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT] Todo List

**Today's Progress**: Trying to add the possibility of caching the user's todolist so when the user refreshes or comes back to the app, his/her todolist is still there.

**Thoughts:** Struggling with this local storage thing. I'm able to set the object in cache but not able to retrieve it yet.
