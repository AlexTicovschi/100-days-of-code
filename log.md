# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, 2017
##### [HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT] Todo List

**Today's Progress**: Added CSS and customized some functions.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to style font awesome icons without the use of "span" and "i".

### Day 2: January 2, 2017
##### [HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT] Todo List

**Today's Progress**: Trying to add the possibility of caching the user's todolist so when the user refreshes or comes back to the app, his/her todolist is still there.

**Thoughts:** Struggling with this local storage thing. I'm able to set the object in cache but not able to retrieve it yet.

**Today's Progress**: Studying activities and layouts.

### Day 4: January 4, 2017
##### [JAVA, ANDROID] Activities and layouts

**Today's Progress**: Created a layout with 4 buttons.
* Open Activity - opens another screen
* Open URL - opens an URL
* Open Dialer - opens the dialer with a fixed number
* Edit Text + Open Activity - if the user provides text and clicks on the button, the user will be redirected to a screen with the input.

**Thoughts:** Really enjoying the creation of layouts for Android! :D
